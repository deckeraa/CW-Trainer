Version 0.01 - 2/13/2002

Known bugs:
* Will not play file if all letters are unchecked

* Clears file when "Start CW" is pressed

* General source code ugliness and poor practices... I'm not proud of 
  this code, but it does work. Consider this first version a working
  prototype. I felt it best to get the program "out there" in the
  hands of people who want to use it and especially in the hands of
  people who want to make it better.

Things to fix and features to add:
* Clean up the character speed code and make it more correct.

* Completely revamp the playNextChar() function

* Remove "modal" type code so that it doesn't matter if a file got loaded
  or using random chars. Probably be better to just pre-load a bunch of 
  random characters into m_charpipe and always use it

* Better yet, totally separate the test generation from the GUI code -
  this is the plan

* Make the GUI more attractive and provide a way to configure on the fly.

* Save the state of the program in a .rc file (this should be easy)

* Adjust CW Note Frequency

* Test timer / Timed tests

* QRN (like W4FON's Koch for windows)

* QSB (like W4FON's Koch for windows)

* QRM (record random band noise - sort of the like QRN, but more realistic)

* Add Prosigns to the regular char set (it works in the text files)

* Add volume control

* Adaptable GUI so "simple" versions can be presented. Probably driven
  by a config file. 

* Text file driven lesson planner. Allow teachers to create lessons
  that present the user with a checklist of things to do. Lessons
  will control the program (i.e. use chars K and M at X/Y speed for
  N minutes.

* Figure out a way to make correcting tests easier.
