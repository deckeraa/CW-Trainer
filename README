Welcome to CW Trainer!

Legal Stuff:

This application and its source code are hereby released under the
GPL, Version 2. Please find the enclosed LICENSE for more information
on the GPL.

Initial release date is 2/15/2002 by John Wagner, N1QO -
john@wagner-usa.net

The program uses some Source Code from Ray Goff, G4FON - notably the
EncodeSineWave function. That code is used and released under the GPL
by permission from Ray. It should also be noted that Ray gave me the 
source code to his windows program and from that I was inspired to 
write this program.

The files lcdrange.h and lcdrange.cpp are from the QT Tutorial.
These files may be removed at a later date.

********** BEFORE YOU SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR FEATURES ********** 

Please read the file TODO - the early versions of this program are
more or less working prototypes intended to get something [anything]
out there for Linux to help people learn CW. Numerous features are
planned as well as a general unfudging of the source code. Again, the
early versions are out here just so people have something to use.

Purpose:

This application is intended to teach Morse Code (CW). 

It supports the Koch method;

	Teach at high speed, starting with two characters. When
	those character is recognized 90% of the time then add
	another character. Repeat until using all characters and 90%
	correctness is achieved... then speed up and start over!

Windows software by Ray Goff, G4FON - http://www.qsl.net/g4fon
Go to http://www.google.com/ - type in "koch method" - tons of pages

It supports the Farnsworth method;

	Fast character speed (typically 20wpm) but wide character
	space (start at 5 wpm). Can use all characters at the same
	time or use with the Koch method above.

Requires QT Version >= 3.x multi-thread library (Currently developed against 
libqt3-mt-dev v3.3.4-3) and a Linux system with /dev/dsp sound support. 

Building and running:

Unpack the archive: 

tar zxvf cwtrainer.tar.gz

Ensure you have your QTDIR environment variable set;

export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3

(yours may be different, install the *qt3*-dev package for your system and look
for a directory with this structure:
qt<version>/
           bin/
	   doc/
	   include/
	   lib/
	   mkspecs/
	   plugins/
	   )

type: make

You should now have an executable called "cwtrainer"

Run it!: ./cwtrainer

There is no installation target yet. In the short term you may want to put
cwtrainer into your path if you don't want to give the path to this folder or
change directories each time you run it. Your $HOME/bin directory would be 
great for this, or /usr/local/bin if you want a site-wide location. 

A cwtrainer.pro file is included for tmake users who want to hack on
the program using qmake.

The "Load File..." will read a text file and play it as CW. At the
moment you will note that once you hit the "Stop CW" or "Start CW"
button, you will need to reload the file if you want to play it again.
A sample QSO is included in the file "qso.txt". Also note that Prosigns
are supported in the text file, append a ^ before the prosign;

Examples: ^AR ^BK ^BT ^SK
